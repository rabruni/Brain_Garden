invariants:
  - level: MUST
    statement: Context assembly MUST follow the pipeline defined in the attention template — no ad-hoc assembly
  - level: MUST
    statement: Every pipeline stage MUST be config-driven via the template's config object
  - level: MUST NOT
    statement: Thresholds, weights, patterns, and search depths MUST NOT be hardcoded
  - level: MUST
    statement: Context assembly MUST respect budget constraints (max_context_tokens, max_queries, timeout_ms)
  - level: MUST
    statement: Halting decisions MUST be explicit and logged — no implicit "good enough" stops
  - level: MUST NOT
    statement: The attention service MUST NOT send prompts — it assembles context and returns it to the caller
