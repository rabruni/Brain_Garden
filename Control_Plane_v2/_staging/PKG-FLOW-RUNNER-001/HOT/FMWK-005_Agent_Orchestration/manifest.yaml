invariants:
  - level: MUST
    statement: Every agent execution MUST be governed by a work order — no open-ended permissions
  - level: MUST
    statement: Every work order execution MUST be logged to the ledger (WO_STARTED + WO_EXEC_COMPLETE/FAILED)
  - level: MUST
    statement: Agent instantiation MUST read from framework definitions — agents don't create themselves
  - level: MUST NOT
    statement: The flow runner MUST NOT make LLM calls directly — all prompts go through the prompt router
  - level: MUST
    statement: Budget enforcement MUST be mandatory — agents that exceed budget are stopped
  - level: MUST NOT
    statement: Timeouts, budget defaults, and retry counts MUST NOT be hardcoded
  - level: MUST
    statement: v2 extension points (multi-step, aperture, delegation, recovery) MUST be defined as interfaces in v1 code
